This is a Prototype Atto-Story App which uses OpenAi's LLMs to Analyze News and provide Insights for the most recent news stories per selected catagory

There are two options for receiving the insights, 1) Via Audio and 2) via Text on the web page (See the Screen shot below for an example)

It is only a prototype so use at your own risk
